# Seam Navigator

During the pandemic I ran a [D&D game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) for a group of my friends. The game was set in a mythical world where airships would fly between different floating cities, towns and villages. This world was known as "The Seam".

Some of the routes between these towns were well established "chalked" routes lit with lights, whilst others were not as well established. Navigating between these non-established routes was far more dangerous due to the perpetual darkness that covered the world of the Seam. Flying like this was known as flying "through the black".

As the game went on, I found that calculating the distances the players were travelling to be pretty time consuming without a tool to do the maths for me. At the same time, I was also interested in trying out React. The result is "[Seam Navigator](https://seam-navigator.callumh.io)", a web tool that finds the shortest path between two locations in the Seam.
